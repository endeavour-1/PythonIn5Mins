##Augmented Assignment Operator
x = 10
# x=x+3
x+=3

#Same for Subtraction
x-=3



# Operator Precedence
# In Python Exactly like in Mathematics We have a Certain Order to Add or Multiply
x = 10+3*2
#Output will be 16.


## Comparison Operator
x= 3>2
print(x)
#We get "True" or "False" as Output based on our Given Input.

#Equality Operator
x= 3==2
#InEquality Operator
x= 3!=2
#We get "True" or "False" as Output based on our Given Input.
